This example tests support for:

* Phi node with multiple predecessors
* STP shared memory region after several functions
* Assignment starts before declaration
* Function pointer arguments
* Merge lists of symbolic values from both versions
* Bitcasts as part of block prologue
* Ignore column info when matching
* Fork when bit-testing pointers
* Location model using source line after assignment
* Meaningful phi node at start of block
* Fork when null testing pointers
